<h2 id="l1-regularization">1. L1 Regularization</h2>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<p>
  L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, is a technique that
  adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the sum of the
  absolute values of the model's coefficients. The purpose of L1 regularization
  is to encourage sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to become
  exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.
</p>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 border bg-dark text-light">
      $$\text{Loss function with L1 regularization} = \text{Loss function} +
      \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} |w_i|$$
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 border bg-dark text-light">
      The loss function is modified by adding the L1 norm of the coefficient
      vector multiplied by a regularization parameter, lambda. The L1 norm is
      calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the model's weights.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Feature selection: L1 regularization identifies and focuses on the most
    important features, resulting in a more interpretable model.
  </li>
  <li>
    Robustness to irrelevant features: L1 regularization can handle datasets
    with irrelevant features, preventing them from negatively impacting the
    model's performance.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    High dimensionality: L1 regularization may struggle to effectively select
    relevant features in high-dimensional datasets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Non-differentiability: L1 regularization lacks differentiability at zero,
    which can pose challenges during optimization.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="l2-regularization">2. L2 Regularization</h2>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<p>
  L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, involves adding a
  penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the sum of the squares of
  the model's coefficients. Unlike L1 regularization, L2 regularization does not
  force coefficients to become exactly zero, but rather encourages them to be
  small.
</p>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 border bg-dark text-light">
      $$\text{Loss function with L2 regularization} = \text{Loss function} +
      \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2$$
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 border bg-dark text-light">
      The loss function is modified by adding the L2 norm of the coefficient
      vector multiplied by a regularization parameter, lambda. The L2 norm is
      calculated as the sum of the squares of the model's weights.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Overfitting prevention: L2 regularization effectively prevents overfitting
    by discouraging large weights, leading to better generalization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Differentiability: L2 regularization is differentiable everywhere, making
    optimization easier.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Non-robust to irrelevant features: L2 regularization does not perform
    feature selection, making it less effective when dealing with datasets
    containing irrelevant features.
  </li>
  <li>
    Limited sparsity: Unlike L1 regularization, L2 regularization does not set
    coefficients to exactly zero, resulting in less sparsity.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dropout">3. Dropout</h2>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<p>
  Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by
  randomly setting a fraction of the input units or neurons to zero during
  training. It introduces a form of ensemble learning, as multiple models with
  different subsets of neurons are trained simultaneously.
</p>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 border bg-dark text-light">
      <p>During training:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Select a fraction of input units or neurons to be dropped (set to
          zero).
        </li>
        <li>
          Scale the remaining units by a factor of \(\frac{1}{1-p}\), where
          \(p\) is the dropout rate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>During inference:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the entire network without dropout.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 border bg-dark text-light">
      Dropout is implemented during the training phase, where a fraction of the
      input units or neurons is randomly set to zero. The remaining units are
      scaled by a factor of \(\frac{1}{1-p}\), where \(p\) is the dropout rate.
      During inference, the entire network is used without dropout to make
      predictions.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Robustness: Dropout prevents overfitting and makes the model more robust by
    reducing the reliance on specific neurons.
  </li>
  <li>
    Computational efficiency: Training with dropout is computationally more
    efficient compared to training an ensemble of models.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Test-time uncertainty: Dropout is only applied during training, so the
    model's predictions might be more certain during inference than they should
    be.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sensitivity to dropout rate: Selecting an appropriate dropout rate is
    crucial. A rate that is too high can result in underfitting, while a rate
    that is too low might not provide sufficient regularization.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-augmentation">4. Data Augmentation</h2>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<p>
  Data augmentation is a technique that artificially expands the training
  dataset by creating modified copies of the existing samples. It introduces
  variations such as translations, rotations, flips, and scaling to enhance the
  model's ability to generalize.
</p>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 border bg-dark text-light">
      <ul>
        <li>Apply various transformations to the existing training samples.</li>
        <li>
          Examples of transformations: flipping, rotation, translation, scaling
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 border bg-dark text-light">
      Data augmentation involves applying various transformations to the
      existing training samples. These transformations can include flipping,
      rotation, translation, scaling, and more. By creating modified copies of
      the data with these variations, the training dataset is expanded,
      providing the model with more diverse examples to learn from.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Increased robustness: Data augmentation exposes the model to a wider range
    of variations, improving its ability to handle real-world scenarios.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mitigates overfitting: By expanding the training dataset, data augmentation
    reduces the risk of overfitting and helps the model learn more diverse
    patterns.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Increased computational cost: Generating augmented samples on-the-fly during
    training can significantly increase computational requirements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Augmentation quality: The quality of augmented samples heavily depends on
    the chosen transformations, and inappropriate augmentation techniques can
    introduce unrealistic patterns.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="early-stopping">5. Early Stopping</h2>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<p>
  Early stopping is a technique that stops the training process before the model
  starts to overfit. It monitors a validation metric, such as the validation
  loss, and stops training when the metric no longer improves.
</p>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 border bg-dark text-light">
      <p>Algorithm:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Monitor the validation metric during training.</li>
        <li>
          If the metric does not improve for a specified number of epochs
          (patience), stop training.
        </li>
        <li>
          Restore the model weights to the point of the best validation metric.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 border bg-dark text-light">
      Early stopping involves monitoring a validation metric during training. If
      the metric does not improve for a specified number of epochs (patience),
      the training is stopped. The model weights are then restored to the point
      of the best validation metric, ensuring the model is not overfitting.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Prevents overfitting: Early stopping stops the training process at the
    optimal point, preventing the model from memorizing noise and focusing on
    the most relevant patterns.
  </li>
  <li>
    Time efficiency: Early stopping helps save time and computational resources
    by stopping the training process once it is no longer beneficial.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Risk of underfitting: Early stopping might stop training too early,
    resulting in a model that has not fully converged to the optimal solution.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choosing the right stopping point: Selecting the appropriate patience and
    threshold for stopping can be challenging and requires careful
    consideration.
  </li>
</ul>
